## Interactive Map with JSON Data Implementation

Your interactive map has been successfully updated to display JSON data for each state! Here's what has been implemented:

### Features Added:

1. **Dynamic JSON Data Display**: Each state now shows:
   - State name
   - Number (custom numeric value)
   - Population (formatted with commas)
   - Area in km² (formatted with commas)

2. **Enhanced Tooltips**: Improved styling with:
   - Better readability
   - Rounded corners
   - Enhanced shadows
   - Proper spacing

### Sample Data Format:

When you hover over any state, you'll see data like:
```
West Bengal
Number: 26
Population: 91,347,736
Area: 88,752 km²
```

### How to Customize:

1. **Modify state-data.js** to update the numbers for each state
2. **Change data fields** by editing the `getStateDataString()` function
3. **Adjust styling** in map-style.css for the `#tryjstip` element

### Files Modified:

- `js/state-data.js` - Contains all the JSON data for states
- `js/map-config.js` - Updated hover configurations 
- `css/map-style.css` - Enhanced tooltip styling
- `index.html` - Added state-data.js reference

### Next Steps:

You can easily modify the numeric values in `state-data.js` to match your specific requirements. The system is designed to be flexible and easily maintainable.

The map is now running on http://localhost:8080 - hover over any state to see the JSON data in action!
